# Changelog

All notable changes to `freemkv` (the CLI and the desktop app — one binary,
two shells over `freemkv-engine`) are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and the project
follows semantic versioning.

## [1.6.0] — UNRELEASED

### Added

- **One `freemkv` binary, two shells.** The CLI and the desktop app are now the
  same crate over the shared `freemkv-engine`. A CLI-style invocation (any
  arguments, or a bare launch from a terminal) runs the command line — behaviour
  identical to the previous `freemkv` CLI, byte for byte. A windowed launch (a
  `.app` double-click, or `freemkv gui`) opens the desktop app.
- **freemkv for Mac — a native desktop app.** Open a disc or a disc image, tick
  the titles and tracks you want, press Rip. Runs the same `freemkv-engine` as
  the CLI, so it inherits the same recovery, decryption, and mux behaviour.
  - Ships as a `.dmg` per architecture (Apple Silicon and Intel).
  - Reads every source the CLI does — `iso://`, `mkv://`, `m2ts://`, `mp4://` —
    by file picker or Finder drag-and-drop.
  - Per-title and per-track selection with tri-state rollup, an output-format
    picker that follows the source kind, live progress with engine-derived
    speed and ETA, and a copyable log.
  - Key state is reported from the resolution trace, so the app names the
    source that actually unlocked the disc (`keydb` or `online`) instead of
    guessing from the disc's key-origin tag.
  - The Windows app is in development. All decision-making lives in a
    platform-neutral core, so the Windows shell renders the same model and
    reuses the same tests.
- **Audio / subtitle stream selection: `-a` / `-s`.** Choose which language
  tracks land in the output instead of always keeping every audio and subtitle
  stream. Each flag takes `all`, `none`, or a comma-separated language list —
  names or ISO codes, mixed freely and case-insensitively (`-a English,spa`,
  `-s eng`). Default (flag absent) is `all` — bit-for-bit the previous output.
  A language that matches no stream lists the disc's actual languages and fails
  the rip (a typo shouldn't silently ship the wrong file).

### Changed — BREAKING

- **`-t` now defaults to the MAIN TITLE only, not all titles.** With no `-t`
  flag, obfuscated discs with 50+ near-equal-length playlists turned a 40 GB
  disc into ~200 GB of near-duplicate MKVs. It now rips title 1 only.
  **Migration:** add `-t all` to restore the old all-titles default. `-t N`
  (repeatable, 1-based) is unchanged; `-t 0` is still invalid.

### Changed

- Internal: the CLI runs on **`freemkv-engine`** — the multi-title rip loop,
  disc→ISO recovery (`copy` / `CopyOptions`, the sweep/patch strategy), and a
  single shared `SpeedEstimator` for progress speed + ETA. It muxes through
  `libfreemkv::mux_stream`, brings drives up through `DiscSession`, scans ISOs
  through `scan_iso`, and resolves AACS keys through the library. No
  user-visible change; fewer places for the front-ends to drift.

### Fixed

- **Fail fast on a disc with no decryption key.** A multi-title rip (`-t all`)
  against an AACS disc with no usable key used to print the "no key" error once
  per title. It now stops after the first failure with one clear error.
- **Ctrl-C is a full stop.** Interrupting a multi-title rip previously cancelled
  only the title in progress and moved on. Ctrl-C now stops the whole rip
  immediately; the mapfile/staging is preserved, so re-running resumes.

### Known limitations

- The desktop app is **not notarized**, so the first launch needs
  right-click → Open.
